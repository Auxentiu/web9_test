            <p>Walking down a street, full of people, we all sometimes wonder what actually is happening in others minds. Are the thoughts behind those beautiful eyes just bland and shallow, or is there something more appealing than that? We can’t know. Even if we ask them, we don’t get the full answer, the truth. Because, maybe it’s embarrassing, maybe it’s nothing to say really…maybe it’s just infinite emptiness, maybe it’s nothing more than just the usual garbage one thinks every second, our minds being occupied by the most menial of tasks, and common problems. But we make our own stories about the people we see and meet. We have this power of manufacturing the truth to our pleasing, we are rarely in contact with reality. But what is reality if not just projections of each individual brain. I can’t imagine two people having an identical view on what is real to the last detail. People do see eye to eye, but i don’t believe in perfect sync, as perfection cannot exist in this universe. So, is there reality? Or this world is nothing more than just a huge computer collecting virtual lives. I don’t deny that there is a reality, I’m just wondering if we are able to see it. And i don’t think we are looking for it. We are not interested in what reality has to offer us, because we associate it with misery, disaster, overwhelming changes in our rhythm, and just the possibility of accomplishment and satisfaction, never certainty, which is the scariest thing in the world.</p>

              <p>  In fact, we are our own gods. We create, we destroy, we do whatever dumb thing we want in our heads. We create so much virtual reality, so many scenarios, so much stories about ourselves and the ones we meet or just skip a glance on, it’s astonishing that we don’t go mad more often, that we can keep a track on all of it. Isn’t the brain the most marvelous thing in the entire known universe? We don’t give it enough credit and attention. Just take a minute and think about yourself, your own beautiful fucked up mind and brain, and try to see what I’m seeing. Individual creation…</p>

               <p> …but, so much of what we create is now just uploaded on the internet, and i don’t know what to make of it. When we first got in touch with the internet, we found ourselves in an unlimited universe, no borders, no nothing. Empty space in which we can build another life, another identity, another human. And so we did…because it’s so easy, and the consequences are too insignificant to even bother us a little when we do mistakes. We can always move, delete, copy and paste…</p>
