            <p> I'm a simple man, with the age of 22 and my name is Auxentiu (seriously. I will try and be rather brief whilst i tell you a bit about myself. </p>
            <p> An important fact to know about me is that i'm a Formula 1 fan, which includes watching all the races, practices, tests and qualifying sessions live, despite the odd hours from around the globe. It also entails keeping up with the news, watching old races, season reviews, interviews and even playing Formula 1 games from time to time.  Formula 1 is the pinnacle of motorsport. Only 22 drivers drive in this category, the budget  from all the teams combined per season can get to 3 billion â‚¬. Maybe some of you get the sense of the level of technical development and innovation that goes into this sport, and it is highly competitive as each championship point means money at the end of the year. </p>

            <br>
            
            <p> Then, i'm a moviephile, having watched hundreds or thousands of movies of all genres, i've lost count a long time ago. If you want a list with all my favourite movies, just give me a message, and i will provide. Also, tv shows are part of this, i've lost countless nights when discovering a new and brilliant series.  </p>
            <p>Hiking has been a passion of mine since i've been a teenager, but unfortunaly in the last few years i haven't been able to do it as much, but i'm hopefull that i'll pick it up where i left. Other than that i can tell you that i've been a car man since birth, i'm interested in astronomy, physics, politics, history, human nature and so on. </p>
